Table: Logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

 

Logs table:
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+

Result table:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct Num as ConsecutiveNums
from Logs
where (Id + 1, Num) in (select * from Logs) and (Id + 2, Num) in (select * from Logs)

table:
	Id	Num
0	1	1
1	2	1
2	3	1
3	4	2
4	5	1
5	6	2
6	7	2

Output
{"headers": ["ConsecutiveNums"], "values": [[1]]}
