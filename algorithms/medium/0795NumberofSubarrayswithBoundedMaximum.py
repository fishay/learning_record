We are given an array nums of positive integers, and two positive integers left and right (left <= right).
Return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) subarrays such that the value of the maximum array element in that subarray is at least left and at most right.

Example:
Input: 
nums = [2, 1, 4, 3]
left = 2
right = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three subarrays that meet the requirements: [2], [2, 1], [3].
    
Note:
left, right, and nums[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
The length of nums will be in the range of [1, 50000].

class Solution:
    def numSubarrayBoundedMax(self, nums: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> int:
        ans, low, mid = 0, 0, 0
        for num in nums:
            if num > right: mid = 0
            else:
                mid += 1
                ans += mid
            if num >= left: low = 0
            else:
                low += 1
                ans -= low
        return ans
